In 1997, as part of its work previewing the upcoming MLB season, Sports Illustrated published a photograph of five young shortstops, all assumed to be key parts of their teams' futures, as well as the league's. Here's how [longtime SI writer Tom Verducci described the group](https://www.si.com/vault/1997/02/24/223063/long-on-shortstops-the-yankees-derek-jeter-is-part-of-a-rich-crop-of-young-players-who-are-redefining-the-position):

`At the head of the class are five others who are already setting standards at the position: Rey Ordonez, 24, of the New York Mets, an acrobat in spikes; Edgar Renteria, 21, of the Florida Marlins, a .309 hitter last season with more range than Cecilia Bartoli; Alex Gonzalez, 23, of the Toronto Blue Jays, who hit 14 home runs and successfully handled more fielding chances per nine innings than any other regular shortstop in '96; and Rodriguez, 21, and Jeter, 22, the only shortstops who started 140 games and hit .300 or better with at least 10 home runs last season. Those two are the prototypes of the new generation of shortstops.`
